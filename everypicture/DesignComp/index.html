        <h2>Design Development Improvements </h2>
        <p>Some improvements I decided to incorporate in my project was to use photos that had different elements such as different times of the day or people in my images. I also decided to use a font for the main title that looked like the letters were made of clouds so it was cohesive with the overall background. </p>

        <p>Other improvements I worked on was adding better styling such as selecting the typography I want to use in my cards. I also decided to change the weights in the typography because although the cards scale up the font is still small at the size I had them in the experiment.</p>
